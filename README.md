This repository introduces MCSD, containing 10.57 hours of video (aligned with post-edited error-free transcriptions). The dataset achieved a Fleissâ€™ kappa of 0.74 (unweighted) and 0.79 (annotation certainty-weighted). Validation using a SVM achieves a 76.64% F1-score. The standardized annotation pipeline can be used to replicate the dataset curation in other languages (see Section 2.2 Annotation process below).
